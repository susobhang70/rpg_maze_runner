Indrajit was brought up to hate Shangguojia and he developed a zeal to topple the Shangguojia government. Aged 5 Indrajit had already learnt the entire world map of Shangguojia. By the age of 10 he was fluent in the Shangguojia dialect and had vast knowledge of the political situation of Shangguojia. At the age of 18 he started questioning the ideology and morals he developed and decided to go on a little adventure to uncover the truth. He snuck out under the cover of night and headed to Shangguojia. On his arrival to Shangguojia he saw what he expected masses of unhappy civilians toiling away while the rich and powerful enjoyed the fruits of their labor.
