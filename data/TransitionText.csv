"Indrajit was brought up to hate Shangguojia
and he developed a zeal to topple 
the Shangguojia government.
aged 5 Indrajit had already learnt 
the entire world map of Shangguojia.
By the age of 10 he was fluent 
in the Shangguojia dialect and had 
vast knowledge of the political 
situation of Shangguojia. 
At the age of 18 he started questioning 
the ideology and morals he developed 
and decided to go on 
a little adventure to uncover the truth. 
He snuck out under the cover of night 
and headed to Shangguojia. 
On his arrival to Shangguojia 
he saw what he expected masses of 
unhappy civilians toiling away while the 
rich and powerful 
enjoyed the fruits of their labor."
"Indrajit knew there was something more 
that he didn't see. Indrajit felt that this was all 
a cover for something a lot more scary than 
an oppressed nation. He spent several years there 
living as a civilian and infiltrated 
multiple government agencies. After several years 
Indrajit successfully found the secret he was looking for, 
Shanguojia was no country , it was nothing but a farce.
Indrajit discovered that the civilians were nothing but animations
Of lifeless dolls created by superior technology."
"The country was a cover for a powerful individual 
who was gathering resources for world domination. 
This powerful Individual was Indrajits Father. 
They were gathering and storing the resources 
in an “inescapable” labyrinth called shangri-la. 
Indrajit decided to infiltrate shangri-la and 
destroy the resources to foil the his father's plan. 
On entrance to Shangri-La Indrajit was caught and imprisoned. 
On imprisonment his memories were taken away "
