"Shangtsu has been caught stealing cattle, and is brought into town for justice. The judge is his future wife Indravati , who wants to show him some sympathy, but the law clearly calls for two shots to be taken at Shangtsu from close range. To make things a little better for Shangtsu, Indravati tells him she will place two bullets into a six-chambered revolver in successive order. She will spin the chamber, close it, and take one shot. If Shangtsu is still alive, she will then either take another shot, or spin the chamber again before shooting.

Shangtsu is a bit incredulous that his own ex-wife would carry out the punishment, and a bit sad that she was always such a rule follower. He steels himself as Indravati loads the chambers, spins the revolver, and pulls the trigger. Whew! It was blank. Then Indravati asks, 'Do you want me to pull the trigger again, or should I spin the chamber a second time before pulling the trigger?

What should Shangtsu choose?",let gretchen pull it,,,
